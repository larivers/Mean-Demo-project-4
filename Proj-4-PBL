##MEAN STACK DEPLOYMENT TO UBUNTU

We are aware of the other application stacks (LAMP,LEMP, MERN) why MEAN ? Why is it so widely adopted, ?  
The main reason for preferring MEAN stack over others is because of the use of a single language throughout the development i.e, for both client-side and server-side. 
Since all these technologies are written in JavaScript, web development process becomes neat.

## WHAT IS THE MEAN STACK
MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications.
 M - MongoDB ( Database)
 E - Express ( Back-end Web Framework)
 A - Angular (Front-end Framework)

 To proceed with the MEAN Stack deployment, we update and upgrade our based OS (Ubuntu).
 
 Next we proceed to install node.js
